#Reflections
* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	* I honestly did not feel like I had any problems with Git until my GPS session, because everything went smoothly for me during the challenges, but now I see that there is much more to Git than I realized
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	* I feel as if the exchanges between local Git and Github were clarified to me throughout the session, especially seeing how it works between two people and two different local Gits to the same GitHub repository
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	* I asked about the specifics of different git commands as well as Markdown syntax to help me figure out when to use what exactly
* What still confuses you about Git?
	* I am still kind of confused about merging branches, specifically about when to merge which branch into the other i.e master into feature versus feature into master
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	* I would describe my first experience as very helpful academically and socially. I got to see how collaboration works across different locations as well as get help from my pair and the guide as needed. My pair and I were good at communicating how the other was thinking and how to help each other.
